This project is an application that uses the OpenZWave Z-Wave library and provides a html/javascript user interface to monitor and manage Z-Wave compatible nodes and networks. The GNU libmicrohttpd library is used to provide HTTP.

An example of the interface is [here](http://fnu.iranger.com/ozwcp.jpg).

See this [link](http://code.google.com/p/openzwave-control-panel/issues/detail?id=2) for one user's recipe on how to build it.
